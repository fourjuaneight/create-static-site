# Static Templates

This is a simple script that uses [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) and the [fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module to copy template and config files for various Static-Site Generators, onto the current directory.

This is very much for personal use, but PRs are welcomed.
